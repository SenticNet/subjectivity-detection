Polarity and Subjective classification with Multitask Learning and BERT Embedding
================
>Multi task learning often helps to improve the perfor-mance of related tasks. Related tasks often have inter-dependence  on  each  other  and  perform  better  whensolved in a joint framework. In this paper, we presenta deep multi-task learning framework that jointly performs sentiment and subjective analysis. We propose an attention based multi task model for predicting the sentiment and subjectivity. The input sentences are transformed using pretrained BERT and Glove embeddings and  the  results  depict  that  BERT  embedding  based model works better than Glove based model. We com-pare our approach with state of the art models in bothsubjective  and  sentiment  classification  in  both  singletask  and  multi  task  frameworks.  Our  results  suggest that multitask learning framework offers improvement over the single task framework even with two different datasets.
